The administrator of a large network wants to create a system administration console tool. The network is composed of network elements of several types: computers, network-attached file systems, routers, etc. Some elements may share a common method for providing administrative information across the network, while others have a unique method. Some areas of the network are divided into subnets which contain network elements. The tool will allow the administrator to consider subnets as a network element themselves. Subnets can reside within subnets based on subnet mask. The tool will allow the administrator to obtain information about each network element. The tool will allow the administrator to run operations to obtain information about the overall network. Example operations are gathering cumulative statistics of energy consumption, temperature, and the status of diagnostic checks. This could be for a single network element, or all network elements of one element type. Another example operation would be to determine which are the n most heavily loaded elements in the network.
